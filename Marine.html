                <p>Marine biodiversity is the variety of life in our ocean. It includes all animals, plants and
                    microorganisms living in our ocean, from barnacles to whales to coral reefs. The term is also used
                    to describe the abundance of species living in an area.

                <p>The amazing variety of life in our oceans is under threat. Marine animals are getting entangled in
                    plastic debris, mistaking it for food or getting trapped. Pollution from land runs into the ocean,
                    harming ecosystems and creatures. This loss of marine diversity disrupts the delicate balance of the
                    ocean, affecting everything from the fish we eat to the very health of our planet.</p>

                    The future of our ocean's astounding variety of life depends on our actions. By making small changes
                    in our daily habits, we can collectively make a big difference. Supporting sustainable seafood
                    choices through certifications like the MSC label reduces pressure on fish populations. Saying no to
                    single-use plastics and properly disposing of waste helps keep our oceans clean. Advocating for
                    policies that limit overfishing and protect marine habitats safeguards ecosystems for future
                    generations. Joining beach clean-up efforts and raising awareness about marine conservation all
                    contribute to a healthier ocean teeming with life.
